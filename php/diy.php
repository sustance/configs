# Refilling your HP LaserJet Pro M15w printer's 48A cartridge 


### disassembling the cartridge, cleaning internal components, replacing the toner powder using a special tool to melt a hole in the cartridge, and then reassembling it and replacing the chip. It is a challenging DIY task that requires specific tools and expertise, with the risk of damaging the printer or cartridge.

Disassemble the Cartridge:

Remove the end cap on the right side of the cartridge. 

Separate the toner and drum sections by sliding the toner section away from the drum section. 

Remove the charge roller from the drum. 

Carefully unscrew the doctor blade and remove it. 

Clean the Cartridge:

Use compressed air to clean out any remaining toner powder from the cartridge. 

Clean the magnetic roller with a dry, soft cloth. 

Clean the charge roller with water and isopropyl alcohol. 

Refill with Toner:

You will need a special toner hole tool kit to melt a hole in the cartridge, as the 48A cartridge does not have a convenient fill port. 

Carefully pour approximately 60g of black HP toner into the cartridge through the newly created hole. 

Reassemble the Cartridge:

Carefully clean and reinstall the doctor blade and the two plastic spacers. 

Reinstall the end cap and screw. 
Insert the charge roller. 

Place the drum section into the toner section, ensuring the hinge pins fit into their holes. 

Reinstall the drum end cap and screw. 

Turn the developer roller by hand to ensure it is correctly installed. 

Replace the Chip: A new chip must be installed on the cartridge every time it is refilled.
