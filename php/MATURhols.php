UBS HR relocates specialist jobs to Poland
Under the "relocation" program, assignments land in Eastern Europe, and Swiss employees are forced to relocate or go to the job center. The same applies to Swiss Re, where they are in India.

Zurich loves UBS. And Google. And Zurich. And Swiss Re.

The large companies offer good jobs and high incomes – which are also necessary for a life in Switzerland's expensive economic center.

But now the deal is collapsing. More and more jobs are disappearing in Zurich. They're moving east.

Currently in Human Resources at UBS, or HR for short. Under a relocation program, the affected employees must decide whether they want to work in Poland.

The major bank has long operated service centers there. Credit Suisse also had such centers. Together, the Polish back offices now represent a significant portion of the jobs offered.

UBS HR staff now have a choice between moving to Poland or going to the job center. According to an insider, a relocation project is set to get underway in the coming weeks.


This affects many human resources employees at Switzerland's last major bank. The bank has not yet responded to any questions.

Global HR is headed by a Swiss citizen who has had a rapid rise to the top. His name is Stefan Seiler, who has been a member of the financial giant's executive board since 2023.

UBS is in good company with its relocation approach. At Swiss Re, most of a key IT team has just been informed of a significant relocation.

It's about risk management within IT, which addresses the risks in the reinsurer's central IT projects.

Around 90 percent of the positions within Swiss Re's IT risk management end up in one of the Swiss multinational's service centers in India, says an insider.

“We are continuously working to optimize the organizational structure of our IT teams to meet the changing needs of the business,” the company said in a statement in response to questions.

"This also includes ensuring that we make optimal use of our expertise across all locations. Swiss Re supports all affected employees during their respective transition phases, offering them support from HR and line managers, employee assistance programs, and internal job opportunities."

With this, Swiss Re is more or less blatantly confirming the relocation of these jobs to the subcontinent. These are well-paid positions that are disappearing in Zurich.

The reinsurer's chief technology officer is responsible for the cost-cutting measures. Pravina Ladva, originally from India, is a member of the Lake Zurich-based multinational's management team for eight years.
