Process the included csv file.
Take account of the "Notes" at the bottom

Create a file to import into "My Maps" on Google maps in a new layer
format in the most versatile format (CSV, KML, KMZ)

That file should contain:
For each trip, defined as starting from "Home base" to return to "home base".
- place a point on map and "port name" code label for each destination.
- join each point of each "trip" with a solid line for flights and dotted line for trains.
- label each leg of each "trip" with the date in "MM/DD" format.
- attempt to avoid labels overlaying one another
