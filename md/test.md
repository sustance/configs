**Identity²: Experiments in digital sovereignty—curating the open web, building resilient tools, and reclaiming your online self.**

### **Identity²**
**Identity² is not about hiding. It’s about building.**
It’s an ongoing experiment in **digital sovereignty**—the practice of taking deliberate control over your online presence, tools, and data. This isn’t just pseudonyms; it’s a mission to explore and demonstrate what’s possible outside the walled gardens.

**Our philosophy is built on three pillars:**
1.  **The Resilient Self:** Cultivating a digital identity that is **anti-fragile**—modular, redundant, and adaptable. It’s about freedom from careerism, hype cycles, and validation-seeking. It’s building a presence that functions without the constant friction of pop-ups, cookie consents, and subscription traps.

2.  **The Open Commons:** Enhancing life with what is freely and openly shared. We locate, test, and document **free books, software, networks, and infrastructure** from the public commons. We focus on non-commercial, unrestricted tools and believe in giving back to the ecosystem that enables us.

3.  **The Sovereign Toolkit:** Building functional, global systems that transcend local constraints—be they censorship, latency, or infrastructure gaps. We escape vendor lock-in by leveraging modern, low-cost hardware (like IoT devices) and community support to create our own solutions. The goal is to **do something useful**, even if that utility is simply proving a resilient alternative can exist—acting as a "canary for the open web."

**Identity² is a thematic umbrella for projects that explore this intersection:** the curated identity, the protected connection, and the hand-built tool. It’s where practical documentation meets philosophical inquiry, all aimed at reclaiming a piece of the digital frontier.

This is the Grand Puzzle, stress-testing the very fabric of the decentralized internet. You're asking: "With just the spare parts left lying around in the public digital commons, can I build something that lasts and connects?"

<hr>
By attempting "Only free public open source components": This is the Constrained Art Form. It's the hacker's version of a sonnet. The limitation is the source of creativity. You're exploring the lower bounds of sovereignty. No AWS, no Cloudflare, no proprietary SaaS. Just git clone, public peering, and ingenuity.

"Digging into the possible, not the ideal": This is the Philosophical Core. You are a pragmatic utopian. You're not writing manifestos about how the net should be. You're getting your hands dirty with how it could be, right now, with the tools at hand. This is empirical philosophy.

"Pleasure and Leisure": This is the Emotional Engine. The joy is in the digging itself—in the "aha!" moment when you get BGP to work over a weird tunnel, or when you stitch together rsync, inetd, and a shell script to make a distributed log. The process is the product.


### Sub-Domains: Thematic Pillars
1. **Layer 1: Personal Identity Resilience** (`curate.identity2.com`).
How do you, as a human, remain functional and sovereign online?
2.  **Layer 2: Network Structural Resilience** (**`maker.identity2.com`**).
    *   **This is your Grand Puzzle's home.** This sub-domain documents the architecture, the scripts, the configs, the failures, and the triumphs of building your global net from scraps.
3.  **Layer 3: Application Resilience** (`maker.identity2.com`).
    *   The devices and software that *run on* the resilient network. The LilyGO projects are the "things" your network carries. This is where the affiliate play cleanly fits.
