###Notes on Printers
CANON G3000

THE INKS THEMSELVES seem to be OK

Seems to always use all 4 colors to create black
- PERHAPS plain paper selection makes it K only (INCONSISTENT)
- plain paper can look true BLACK 
- all other settings black is a DARK BROWN
- Print is darker (browner?) using photo paper setting
- 
  NOT ALL PHOTO SELECTIONS ARE EQUAL ,"photo paper"" is OK

The magenta is sometimes offset horizontally

- Try from windows etc ALIGN HEADS WHEN CAN FIND INTERFACE
