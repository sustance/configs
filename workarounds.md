# Hotel etc. WiFi
Modern desktops (DMs) tend to be able to to automatically pop up well behaved third party Wifi logins in the default browser. 
I use a WM not a DMonly system this may not happen.

I am not even sure that it is a good idea, it seems rather promiscuous, 
any case I have not yet succeded in reproducing this behaviour, herewith notes on workarounds. 

## General notes
Some browsers will process http:// and https:// addresses and some only https://
Some Wifi providers systems are not well behaved and some insist on http:// tansactions
In 2024 Firefox is my only intalled browser to process http://

Try the tactics below, in all cases connect to the Wifi first.

### Go to any external link
with browser

### Go to 192.168.96.1 
with browser

### Go to http://neverssl.com 
Dont use https: for this! (i.e. Firefox)
Check have 8.8.8.8 in /etc/resolv.conf.

## Using iproute 
with cli:$> ip route 
  Example output: 
  default via 192.168.96.1 dev wlp3s0 192.168.96.0/20 dev 
  wlp3s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.108.193 
Look at the first line ‘default via 192.168.96.1’. 
Put the value 192.168.96.1, or whatever you get into your browser address bar. 
- Hyatt Singapore: 172.20.0.1

### Using /etc/resolv.conf
After connect to Wifi, not log in.
with cli $> cat /etc/resolv.conf 
Example output 1
  #Generated by NetworkManager
  search reivernet.com
  nameserver 172.17.137.254
Example output 2
  Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8) 
  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND – YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN 
  nameserver 192.168.96.1 nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 
Put the private IP value (192.168.96.1 in this example) into Firefox.
